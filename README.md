# Window-to-the-Present
Written for "The Pilgrimage Project," an interdisciplinary, multi-class exhibit consisting of multimedia installations in Georgetown's historic Old North building, this project was an effort to muddle the line between performer and audience in an exhibition setting. As viewers watched the videos of unknown individuals rear projected on the window, a hidden camera would record the viewers. Those videos would then become part of the archive of materials that were randomly projected onto the window. In order to identify when a viewer approaches the window (to signal that recording should begin) the code utilizes facial recognition supported by the OpenCV library. 

The physical installation, an actual window frame built into a fake brick facade, was an homage to Old North itself and the way that, like a performance is shaped by the audience, a building is shaped by the people that occupy it. In the case of Old North, that means thousands of students, teachers, presidents, janitors. Like Old North, those who participated in this exhibit are now a part of the story of the Window to the Present, a connection between people across time embodied in a physical artifact.

Note: This project was developed almost entirely independently and therefore earlier versions were not loaded onto GitHub. Artifacts of these earlier versions can be seen in various functions that are never called in the main loop. I have decided to leave those small bits of code, which have a negligible effect on the code's functionality and may inspire others to take the code in other directions.
