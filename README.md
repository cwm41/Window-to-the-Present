# Window-to-the-Present
Written for "The Pilgrimage Project," an interdisciplinary, multi-class exhibit consisting of multimedia installations in Georgetown's historic Old North building.  

This project was an effort to muddle the line between performer and audience in an exhibition setting. As viewers watched the videos of unknown individuals rear projected on the window, a hidden camera would record the viewers. Those videos would then become part of the archive of materials that were randomly projected onto the window. In order to identify when a viewer approaches the window (to signal that recording should begin) the code utilizes facial recognition supported by the OpenCV library.
